    <h1>Cuttlefish</h1>
    <p>Cuttlefish or cuttles are <a href="/nowhere">marine</a> molluscs of the order Sepiida. They belong to the class
        Cephalopoda which also
        includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone, which is
        used
        for control of buoyancy.
    </p>
    <h2>Fossil record</h2>
    <p>The earliest fossils of cuttlefish are from the end of the Cretaceous period, represented by Ceratisepia
        from the Late Maastrichtian Maastricht Formation of the Netherlands.Although the Jurassic Trachyteuthis was
        historically considered possibly related to cuttlefish,later studies considered to be more closely related
        to octopus and vampire squid.</p>
